Code for a maze-solving robot as part of the autonomous vehicle challenge for ENGR101 
at Victoria University Wellington

The robot consists of a raspberry pi with an H-bridge and various attachments like a camera, motors 
and IR-distance-sensors. Structural parts are mostly 3D-printed or cut from plastic.
Power comes from a battery. 

The challenge: opening a gate wirelessly, following a white line, finding a way through a maze of white lines 
and finally solving a wall maze.
